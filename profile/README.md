### Stanford Biodesign Digital Health Group

We empower the digital health community to rapidly prototype and build digital health solutions on a variety of platforms.

Our flagship project is [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi), an open-source framework and ecosystem of modules for building modern, interoperable digital health applications. Check out the [Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication) as a great way to get started.

Other featured projects include:
- [LLMonFHIR](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/LLMonFHIR) - using large language models to explain health data
- [HealthGPT](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/HealthGPT) - querying Apple Health Data using natural language
- [Phoenix](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/Phoenix) - web-based builder for FHIR surveys
- [ResearchKitOnFHIR](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ResearchKitOnFHIR) - FHIR questionnaires on iOS with ResearchKit
- [HealthKitOnFHIR](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/HealthKitOnFHIR) - converting HealthKit data to FHIR resources
